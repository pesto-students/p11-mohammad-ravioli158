- Push all your code, including the database schema, to a separate GitHub repository.
- Avoid pushing all your code in a single commit.
- Create separate branches for different parts of your code.
- Push your code incrementally in parts.
- Get code reviews from your mentor for each part.
- After review, merge your code as advised by your mentor.

By following these guidelines, you will create a comprehensive Wealth Portfolio App backend service using Node.js. Remember to communicate effectively with your mentor throughout the process. Good luck with your assignment!

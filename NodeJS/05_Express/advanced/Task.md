## Guidelines

1. Review the end points and design of your service with your mentor before proceeding.
2. Push your code to a separate GitHub repository.
3. Avoid pushing all your code in a single commit.
4. Create separate branches for different parts of your code.
5. Push code incrementally in parts.
6. Get code reviews from your mentor for each part.
7. After review, merge your code as advised by your mentor.

By following these guidelines, you will create a well-structured weather app backend service using Node.js.

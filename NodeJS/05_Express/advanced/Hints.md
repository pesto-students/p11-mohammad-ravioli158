A step-by-step guide on how to implement the Weather App backend service and its API endpoints:

## Step 1: Design Architecture

1. **Identify Components:** Define the main components of your application such as controllers, services, routes, and models (if needed).

2. **Choose Design Patterns:** Decide on the design patterns to use, like the MVC pattern. For example, create separate files for routes, controllers, and services.

## Step 2: Weather API Integration

1. **Select API:** Choose one of the provided weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.com).

2. **Fetch API Key:** Sign up for an API key from the chosen weather API service.

3. **HTTP Requests:** Use a library like `axios` to make HTTP requests to the weather API endpoints and fetch weather data.

## Step 3: Create API Endpoints

1. **Data of Multiple Cities:**
   - Set up an API route (e.g., `/cities`) that accepts query parameters for city name, city code, and pagination.
   - Use the weather API to fetch data for multiple cities based on the provided filters and pagination.

2. **Detailed Forecast for X Days:**
   - Create an API route (e.g., `/forecast`) that accepts the desired number of days (X) as a query parameter.
   - Utilize the weather API to retrieve detailed forecast data for the specified number of days.

3. **Filter Data by City, Date, and Moment:**
   - Implement an API route (e.g., `/filter`) that accepts query parameters for city, date, and moment.
   - Use the weather API or your stored data to filter and return relevant weather information.

4. **Current Weather Conditions of a Specific City:**
   - Set up an API route (e.g., `/current`) that takes the city name as a query parameter.
   - Fetch current weather conditions for the specified city from the weather API.

## Step 4: Code Review and Iteration

1. **Code Review:** Share your implemented API endpoints and code architecture with your mentor for review and feedback.

2. **Refinement:** Make any necessary improvements based on mentor feedback. Ensure your code follows best practices and is well-organized.

## Step 5: GitHub Repository

1. **Create GitHub Repo:** Create a new GitHub repository for your project.

2. **Branching Strategy:** Create separate branches for different parts of your code (e.g., `multiple-cities`, `detailed-forecast`, etc.).

3. **Push Code Incrementally:** Push your code to the respective branches incrementally as you complete each API endpoint.

## Step 6: Code Merging and Finalization

1. **Code Merge:** After each part of your code is reviewed and approved by your mentor, merge the corresponding branches into the main repository.

2. **Documentation:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for each API endpoint, including usage instructions and expected responses.

## Final Tips

- Keep your code modular and well-organized to enhance maintainability.
- Handle errors gracefully by implementing proper error handling mechanisms.
- Test your API endpoints thoroughly using tools like Postman.
- Use environment variables to securely store sensitive information like API keys.
- Communicate regularly with your mentor to ensure you're on the right track.

By following these steps and hints, you should be able to successfully implement the Weather App backend service and its API endpoints. Good luck with your assignment!

create a basic command-line application that reads a user's name from the console, generates a personalized greeting using a custom module, and saves it to a text file using the fs module.

Hints/Steps(refer oly if needed):

- Set up the project folder with three files: `greetings.js`, `app.js`, and an empty text file named `output.txt`.
- Implement the `greetings.js` custom module that exports a function to generate a personalized greeting based on the user's name.
- Create the `app.js` file and import the necessary modules (`fs` and the custom `greetings` module).
- Use `readline` to prompt the user for their name in the `app.js` file.
- Generate a personalized greeting using the `generateGreeting` function from the `greetings` module.
- Save the generated greeting to the `output.txt` file using the `fs.writeFile` function in the `app.js` file.
- Handle any errors that may occur during the file writing process and display an error message if necessary.
- Test the application by running `node app.js` in the terminal, entering your name, and verifying that the greeting is correctly saved in the `output.txt` file.

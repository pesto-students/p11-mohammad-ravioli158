**Mini Project Assignment: Building a Remote Job Dashboard with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB/MySQL**

**Project Overview:**

In this mini project assignment, you will be creating a web service using Node.js and Express that fetches job listings from the RemoteOK API and stores them in a database (MongoDB or MySQL). You will also create multiple API endpoints that will serve data to a dashboard interface where users can view and interact with the job listings.

**Project Requirements:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Set up a new Node.js project using `npm` or `yarn`.
   - Initialize a Git repository to track your project's changes.

2. **Fetching and Storing Data:**
   - Use the `axios` library to make HTTP requests to the RemoteOK API (https://remoteok.io/api) to fetch job listings.
   - Parse the JSON response to extract relevant information such as job title, company name, job type, location, and description.
   - Choose either MongoDB or MySQL as your database. Design the schema to store the job listing data.
   - Use appropriate database library (e.g., `mongoose` for MongoDB or `mysql2` for MySQL) to store the fetched job listings in the database.

3. **Express Routes:**
   - Create an Express application with multiple routes to serve data from database for the frontend dashboard.
   - Implement an endpoint to fetch all job listings from the database.
   - Implement endpoints to filter job listings based on criteria like job type, location, etc.
   - Create an endpoint to retrieve detailed information about a specific job listing based on its unique identifier.
4. [Advanced/Bonus]**User Authentication**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to the dashboard.
   - Implement a end point for a feature to allow users to save or apply for job listings directly from the dashboard.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling for API requests, database operations, and route handling.
   - Display meaningful error messages to users when something goes wrong.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Provide a README.md file that explains how to set up the project locally.
   - Document the project's architecture, including the data schema if using MongoDB or MySQL.
   - Describe the available endpoints and how to use them.
   1. Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to the dashboard.

**Bonus Challenges:**

**Dashboard UI Interface:**
   - Design a simple HTML/CSS dashboard or React User interface that displays the fetched job listings.
   - Display job listings on the dashboard with relevant information.
   - Implement filtering options on the dashboard to allow users to filter job listings based on different criteria.

**Submission:**

1. Share your Git repository with your instructor or evaluator.
2. Provide a brief summary of the project's functionality, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality:** Does the project meet the specified requirements? Do the endpoints work correctly? Can job listings be fetched, stored, and displayed accurately?
2. **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, organized, and easy to understand? Are best practices followed for error handling, asynchronous programming, and modularization?
3. **Database Interaction:** Is the chosen database (MongoDB/MySQL) integrated properly? Is the data schema well-designed and suitable for the project's needs?
4. **Express Usage:** Are the Express routes correctly implemented? Is the dashboard interface user-friendly and responsive?
5. **Documentation:** Is there clear and concise documentation explaining how to set up and use the project?

Remember, this mini project is designed to help you gain practical experience with Node.js, Express, and database interactions. 
Feel free to explore additional features and improvements beyond the requirements. Good luck and have fun building your Remote Job Dashboard!

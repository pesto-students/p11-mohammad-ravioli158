# Ravi's Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website created as part of [Pesto Plus](https://pesto.tech/pesto-plus) program's mini project.

## Pages

The website has the following pages:

1. About Me
2. Resume
3. Contact
4. Blog

Each page is accessible from the navigation bar at the top of the website.

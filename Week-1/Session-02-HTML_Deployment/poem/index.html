    <!-- First stanza of the poem -->
    <p>
      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />
      Are you - Nobody - Too <br />
      Then there's a pair of us! <br />
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    <!-- Second stanza of the poem -->
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br />
      How public - like a frog - <br />
      To tell one's name - the livelong jun - <br />
      To an admiring Bog!
    </p>

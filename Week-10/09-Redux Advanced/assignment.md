Implement the Gift Recommendation App using ReactJS and Redux Toolkit., This should be implemented on top of the session 06 assignment here []

Instructions:
In the previous coding question, you built a Gift Recommendation App using ReactJS without using Redux. In this follow-up question, your task is to refactor the existing app to use Redux Toolkit for managing the application's state.

Requirements:
1. Refactor the Gift Recommendation App to use Redux Toolkit for state management.
2. Define appropriate Redux slices, reducers, and actions to handle the app's state, such as user preferences and recommended gifts.
3. Update the form inputs and components to dispatch Redux actions for updating the state.
4. Modify the component(s) responsible for displaying the recommended gifts to retrieve the data from the Redux store.
5. Ensure that the app remains functional and the recommended gifts are still generated and displayed correctly.
6. Test the app thoroughly to ensure that the Redux implementation is working as expected.

Note:
1. Use Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createAsyncThunk for handling state and asynchronous actions, respectively.
2. Make sure to organize your Redux-related code in separate directories or files for clarity and maintainability.
3. The overall functionality and design of the app should remain similar to the previous version without Redux.

Bonus Tasks (Optional, for extra credit):
1. Implement caching or memoization techniques in Redux Toolkit to avoid unnecessary API calls or state updates.
2. Add loading and error handling states using Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk.
3. Implement additional features or enhancements to improve the app's functionality and user experience.

Submission Guidelines: 
Note: Ensure your code is well-structured, properly commented, and follows best practices for code quality and readability, including Redux-specific guidelines.
Best coding practices & guidelines should be followed from here: [React Best Coding practices](https://github.com/imranmd/ReactBestPracticesAndGuidelines/)
Best of luck, and happy coding!

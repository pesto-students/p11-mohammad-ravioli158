Assignment: Gift Recommendation App in ReactJS using OpenAI API

Instructions:
Your task is to develop a Gift Recommendation App using ReactJS and the OpenAI API. The app should allow users to input certain preferences, such as the recipient's age, gender, and interests, and then generate personalized gift recommendations using the OpenAI API. The app should display the recommended gifts based on the user's preferences.

Requirements:
1. Use ReactJS to build the frontend of the application.
2. Implement a form where users can input the recipient's age, gender, and interests.
3. Validate the form inputs to ensure they are filled correctly.
4. Utilize the OpenAI API to generate gift recommendations based on the user's preferences.
5. Display the recommended gifts on the app's interface.
6. Style the app to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

Note:
1. You can use any styling framework (e.g., CSS, Bootstrap) or UI library (e.g., Material-UI) to style your app.
2. Make sure to handle any errors or edge cases gracefully and provide appropriate error messages or feedback to the user if needed.
3. You are free to use any additional libraries or packages if necessary, but the core functionality should be implemented in ReactJS and the OpenAI API.

Bonus Tasks (Optional, for extra credit):
1. Implement a feature to allow users to save their favorite gift recommendations.
2. Add an option to share the recommendations via email or social media.
3. Implement a search feature to filter the recommendations based on keywords.

Submission:
1. Fork this repository and create a new branch with your name.
2. Develop the Gift Recommendation App based on the requirements mentioned above.
3. Commit your code to the branch you created.
4. Provide a README.md file that includes instructions on how to run your application locally.
5. Submit a pull request with your changes.

Note: Ensure your code is well-structured, properly commented, and follows best practices for code quality and readability.

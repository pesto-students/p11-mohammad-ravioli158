Here are three assignment questions on implementing basic Redux in a React app

1. Question 1:
You are building a To-Do list application using React and Redux. Your task is to implement the Redux store, actions, and reducers for managing the To-Do list. The application should allow users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. Implement the necessary Redux actions and reducers to handle these operations.

Expected Tasks:
- Create a Redux store with initial state for the To-Do list.
- Define Redux actions for adding a task, marking a task as completed, and deleting a task.
- Implement the corresponding reducers to update the state based on the dispatched actions.
- Connect the Redux store to your React components and use the store state to display the To-Do list.



2. Question 2:
You are working on a shopping cart feature for an e-commerce website built with React and Redux. Your task is to implement the Redux store, actions, and reducers to manage the items in the cart. The application should allow users to add items to the cart, remove items from the cart, and update the quantity of items in the cart. Implement the necessary Redux actions and reducers to handle these operations.

Expected Tasks:
- Create a Redux store with initial state for the shopping cart.
- Define Redux actions for adding an item to the cart, removing an item from the cart, and updating the quantity of an item.
- Implement the corresponding reducers to update the state based on the dispatched actions.
- Connect the Redux store to your React components and use the store state to display the shopping cart.



3. Question 3: [Optional]
You are building a blog application using React and Redux. Your task is to implement the Redux store, actions, and reducers for managing blog posts. The application should allow users to create new posts, view existing posts, and delete posts. Implement the necessary Redux actions and reducers to handle these operations.

Expected Tasks:
- Create a Redux store with initial state for the blog posts.
- Define Redux actions for creating a new post, viewing existing posts, and deleting a post.
- Implement the corresponding reducers to update the state based on the dispatched actions.
- Connect the Redux store to your React components and use the store state to display the blog posts.

These assignment questions should provide a good opportunity for students to practice implementing basic Redux functionality in a React application.

Submission Guidelines: 
Note: Ensure your code is well-structured, properly commented, and follows best practices for code quality and readability, including Redux-specific guidelines.
